For the sake of protecting you, my precious person, I shall turn into 
the Chronicle Key
In exchange for the sacrifice of my body, now I shall concentrate in offering this song
Why the power dwells and enters in the people that doesn't need it?
Why the power tortures the kind people that doesn't want to fight for it?

In this sadness, oh, Child of God, Child of Power
If you detest the fighting and seek the eternal peace
I shall send to sleep your power and your body
or the power will turn into a calamity, and it will bring ruin upon them

I shall play a gentle melody
and turn into the Chronicle Key for you sake
In exchange for the sacrifice of my body, now I shall concentrate in offering this song
Why the power dwells and enters in the people that doesn't need it?
Why the power tortures the kind people that doesn't want to fight for it?

If you detest...
(Chorus)
In this sadness, oh, Child of God, Child of Power
(Chorus)
If you detest the fighting...
...and seek the eternal peace

I shall send to sleep your power and your body
I shall concentrate in protecting you, and granting you eternal sleep,
Please, accept the salvation of your darkened soul
And let that the deep laments you have crafted be freed by my prayer

Please, accept the salvation of your darkened soul
And let that the deep laments you have crafted be freed by my prayer
